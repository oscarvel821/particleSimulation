# Particle Simulation

Explore the fascinating realm of particle dynamics with our Particle Simulation App built in Python. This application enables you to simulate the intricate interactions and collisions between virtual particles, all while utilizing the efficient Sweep and Prune algorithm for optimized collision detection.

## Features
- **Realistic Particle Collisions** : Witness particles in action as they collide, merge, and interact realistically within the simulation.

- **Sweep and Prune Optimization**: Enjoy smooth and efficient simulations thanks to the advanced Sweep and Prune technique, ensuring accurate collision detection.

## Planned Enhancements
- **Performance Optimizations:** : Will later on try to implement K-D tree to see performance improvement
- **Continuous Collision** : Will later on try to improve the collision with particles and the border of the box
- **fix bugs** : Will try to fix how particles merge instead of moving away from each other when collision occurs

## Dependency
Python 3.9

Pygame 2.1.3
